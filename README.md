# Dataset-for-Image-Colorization
This repository contains Python scripts for preparing and augmenting the COCO 2017 dataset for image colorization tasks. The `prepare_dataset.py` script filters removed images and pushes modified datasets to Hugging Face Hub. The `augment_captions.py` script adds randomized colorization prompts to captions, enhancing dataset diversity.
